****************

This pack contains 12 loops in rock style, several bars long. 

 You can listen to the demo of the whole package: https://soundcloud.com/bosone/rock-loops-demo-for-unity3d-asset-store



 This is a pack of rock loops that share the same tempo and sound. You can loop a single clip or you can try to connect the different clips one after the other to crate more complex soundtrack, even following your gameplay. This loop pack will be part of a more complete asset with tentative name "rock construction kit". It will include loop intro (you find a selection of 3 intros in this pack) and loop outro (you find 5 different ends for the loops). There will also be solos and main melodies included, so stay tuned! 

 This is the initial release of the asset. It will be expanded with more loops and it will part of a more extended project called "rock loops construction kit", that will be sold separately. 

 If you purchase this initial release you will encourage me in the development, you will be able to get the future updates of this asset free of charge and to upgrade to the complete "rock loops construction kit" at a discounted price. 

 As a bonus, you get also some free clips of my other unity3d assets.
