Thanks for purchasing my pack!

You find here a collection of short metal loop. For your convenience, each loop is divided in several clips:

1) "complete": this is the short song "as recorded", it plays just once from the beginning to the end. It is not meant to be looped but played one time.

2) "intro": to be used as an intro, i.e. the first clip to be played. After this you can play the loop part.

3) "loop": the looped part. If you play this clip immediately after the "intro" part it will seamlessly loop. you can play the "loop" part as many times as you want, in order to get a backgound music as long as needed.

4) "end": this is meant to be played immediately after the "Loop" clip. In this way you can end the short song in a convenient way.

If you have problems or want to me to "assemble" a song of a given duration just contact me (matteo@alchemystudio.it). It will be arranged for free!

Who am I?

I’m an independent musician and composer, dealing with a lot of different generes of music, from rock to soundtrack, from ambient to children’s lullabies . The feelings expressed by my music varies a lot from romance and love to epic fantasy, from thriller and horror to hope and joy.

I’m a guitarist, keyboardist and multi-instrumentalist, with an experimental attitude. I have plenty of exotic instruments collected around the world (indian sitar, chinese erhu, dizi and guzheng, turkish saz, etc) and I like to combine them with samples and synth sounds from the PC, as well experimenting with sound design, unusual, and custom build instruments. 

Please help me to reach your needs: if you buy my music, I will be very happy to know how did you find me and why did you choose my items. I am also really interested to know how did you use my music, and I will keep all the informations strictly confidential: so feel free to send me an email.
